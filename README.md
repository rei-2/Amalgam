###### AVX2 may be faster than SSE2 though not all CPUs support it (`Steam > Help > System Information > Processor Information > AVX2`). Freetype uses freetype as the text rasterizer and includes some custom fonts, which results in better looking text but larger DLL sizes.
###### If nightly.link is down, you can still download through [github](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/Amalgam-Comp/actions) with an account.

## Development Setup

### Quick Start
1. **Run the automated setup:**
   ```cmd
   setup.bat
   ```
2. **Open the project:**
   - Open `Amalgam.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
   - Select configuration: `Release` and platform: `x64`
   - Build the solution

For detailed setup instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md).

### Lua Script Porting
For porting Lua scripts to C++, see the comprehensive [LUA_TO_CPP_PORTING_GUIDE.md](LUA_TO_CPP_PORTING_GUIDE.md) with detailed examples, API mappings, and common fixes for successful integration.

## Installation

**AmalgamLoader.exe** (included with downloads) is the recommended injection tool. It's a simple manual map injector with some basic obfuscation and signature randomization tricks.

Alternative: [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases) also works if you prefer a separate injector.
